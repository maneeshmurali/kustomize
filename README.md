# kustomize
Kustomize is a tool for managing Kubernetes configurations that allows users to customize, validate, and generate configuration files for Kubernetes deployments. One of the key benefits of using Kustomize is that it allows users to manage multiple Kubernetes configurations across different environments, such as dev, staging, and production.

To convert normal YAML files to Kustomize, you will need to create a Kustomization file that specifies the base YAML files and any overlays that should be applied.
